A Gauge does not support different aggregation temporalities. Given the aggregation is unknown, points cannot be combined using the same aggregation, regardless of aggregation temporalities. Therefore, AggregationTemporality is not included. Consequently, this also means "StartTimeUnixNano" is ignored for all data points. */
